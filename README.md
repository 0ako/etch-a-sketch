# Etch-a-sketch
Mini-project for The Odin Project.

What I learnt:
- Look for new methods if I suspect they exist. 
- Talk through the problem to myself to find holes in logic or program.
- Use console.log everywhere to understand the problem from different angles
- Leave comments to clarify issues to myself and remove them when no longer needed
