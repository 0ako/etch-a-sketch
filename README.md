# Etch-a-sketch
Mini-project for The Odin Project.

What I learnt:
- Look for new methods if I suspect they exist. 
- To pinpoint problem, talk through the problem to myself to find holes in logic or program.
- To pinpoint problem, use console.log to understand the problem from different angles
- Leave comments to clarify issues to myself and remove them when no longer needed
- To get a string that is randomly generated every time it's called, declare a function that outputs a string literal, then call the function.
